===========
This is more for fun and practices rather than any serious purpose.

The problem is given a NxN array of integers, print out the elements in a "sanke" manner. That is starting from the top-left corner continue to the top-right corner, then drill down to the bottom-right, followed by moving left toward the bottom-left, and finally go upward back to the top left. Repeat with the rest of the elements until all elements are printout.

This is an interview question I encountered before. To make it more interesting, I decided to do it in different languages, including Java, C/C++, Python, and Scala. It also includes two projects for iOS and Android respectively.
